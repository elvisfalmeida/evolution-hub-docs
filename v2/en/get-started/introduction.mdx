**Ebyte Cloud API v2** is a robust platform dedicated to empowering small businesses, entrepreneurs, freelancers, and individuals with limited resources, 
going beyond a simple messaging solution via **WhatsAppâ„¢**.

Our mission is to provide a comprehensive API that enables these groups to strengthen their businesses, whether locally or online, by integrating with **multiple platforms and services**.

Originally, **Ebyte Cloud API** started as a WhatsApp control API based on CodeChat, utilizing the Baileys library. Over time, the platform expanded to 
support not only WhatsApp but also integrations with services like **Typebot, Chatwoot, Dify, and OpenAI**. 
Additionally, the Ebyte Cloud API supports both the WhatsApp API based on Baileys and the official WhatsApp Business API, with future support planned for Instagram and Messenger.
